# Horiseon Refactor

**version 1.0.0**

For my first homework assignment in coding bootcamp, I was given the source code of a website to refactor. 

I refactored both the index.html and style.css pages to meet accessibility standards by adding alt tags to images, semantic HTML with logical structure, and lastly, a clear and descriptive title.
